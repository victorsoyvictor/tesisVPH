\chapter{Simulation of the effect in coverage drop occurred in Denmark}\label{coverageDropDenmark}
In Denmark, the vaccination program started in $2009$ with a coverage of $80\%$. After $5$ years, in $2$ months the coverage drops until $10\%$. It remains $2$ years in $10\%$ and then, in $5$ years increases until $70\%$ and remains constant. In Figure \ref{fig:cobertura_danesa} we show the coverage evolution.

In this simulation, assuming that the coverage will remain constant in the future, we are going to see, in Figure \ref{fig:dinamarca}, the effect of the drop and recovery of the vaccination coverage in the HPV LR 6/11 infections.

	\caption{Comparative of the decline of  HPV 6/11 in 14-64 years old women (a), men (b) and MSM (c) over the time, between the Spanish scenario in black lines (vaccination of girls with a constant coverage of $70\%$) and the Danish scenario in red lines. Note that the drop in the Danish coverage produces a drop in the decline and, even when the coverage is recovered and greater than the Spanish one, there is a delay to reach the same levels of decline as Spain.}

\end{figure}

Observe that the drop in the coverage and the low levels ($10\%$) during 2 years, produces a decreasing in the decline (in red) compared to the Spanish case (in black). In fact, although in Denmark the coverage is recovered and even increased respect to the Spanish one, it is necessary several years to reach the same levels of decline as Spain.
