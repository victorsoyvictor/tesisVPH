	abstract = {Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection of the genital tract is common in young sexually active individuals, the majority of whom clear the infection without overt clinical disease. Most of those who do develop benign lesions eventually mount an effective cell-mediated immune (CMI) response, and the lesions regress. Regression of anogenital warts is accompanied histologically by a CD4+ T cell-dominated Th1 response; animal models support this and provide evidence that the response is modulated by antigen-specific CD4+ T cell-dependent mechanisms. Failure to develop an effective CMI response to clear or control infection results in persistent infection and, in the case of the oncogenic HPVs, an increased probability of progression to high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia and invasive carcinoma. Effective evasion of innate immune recognition seems to be the hallmark of HPV infections. The viral infectious cycle is exclusively intraepithelial: there is no viremia and no virus-induced cytolysis or cell death, and viral replication and release are not associated with inflammation. HPV globally downregulates the innate immune signaling pathways in the infected keratinocyte. Proinflammatory cytokines, particularly the type I interferons, are not released, and the signals for Langerhans cell (LC) activation and migration, together with recruitment of stromal dendritic cells and macrophages, are either not present or inadequate. This immune ignorance results in chronic infections that persist over weeks and months. Progression to high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia with concomitant upregulation of the E6 and E7 oncoproteins is associated with further deregulation of immunologically relevant molecules, particularly chemotactic chemokines and their receptors, on keratinocytes and endothelial cells of the underlying microvasculature, limiting or preventing the ingress of cytotoxic effectors into the lesions. Recent evidence suggests that HPV infection of basal keratinocytes requires epithelial wounding followed by the reepithelization of wound healing. The wound exudate that results provides a mechanistic explanation for the protection offered by serum neutralizing antibody generated by HPV L1 virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines.},

	abstract = {Low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) associated with certain human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes may preferentially progress to cervical cancer. HPV genotyping may thus have the potential to improve the effectiveness of screening programs and to reduce overtreatment. LSIL cases (n = 8,308) from 55 published studies were included in a meta-analysis. HPV genotype distribution was assessed by geographic region and in comparison with published data on cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). HPV detection in LSIL was 80\% in North America but less than 70\% in other regions, most likely reflecting regional differences in LSIL diagnosis. Among 5,910 HPV-positive LSILs, HPV16 was the most common genotype (26.3\%) followed by HPV31 (11.5\%), HPV51 (10.6\%), and HPV53 (10.2\%). HPV-positive LSILs from Africa were 2-fold less likely to be infected with HPV16 than those in Europe, and HPV-positive LSILs from North America were more likely to be infected with HPV18 than those from Europe or South/Central America. Interpretation for rarer genotypes was hampered by variation in HPV testing methodology. SCC/LSIL prevalence ratios indicated that HPV16 was 2-fold and HPV18 was 1.5-fold more common in SCC than in HPV-positive LSIL, thus appearing more likely to progress than other high-risk genotypes (SCC/LSIL prevalence ratios between 0.05 and 0.85). HPV53 and HPV66 showed SCC/LSIL ratios of 0.02 and 0.01, respectively. HPV genotype distribution in LSIL differs from that in cervical cancer, highlighting the importance of HPV genotype in the risk of progression from LSIL to malignancy. Some regional differences in the relative importance of HPV genotypes in LSIL were noted.},
