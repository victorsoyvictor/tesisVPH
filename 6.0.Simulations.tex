\chapter{Simulations}\label{HPVSpain}
In the previous chapters, we have built the network model and it has been validated. Now, in this chapter, we are going to use the model to perform several simulations, including different strategies in order to find out what we can expect applying these plans of action and also, to understand the mechanisms behind the transmission dynamics of the HPV. Some of the simulations have been suggested in the previous chapter. These simulations will focus in Spain, although they can be extrapolated to other countries. 

Some of these simulations will be, in fact, a sensitivity analysis, with the aim to simulate scenarios that may occur at the present time or in the future. We should not forget that the data used to build and calibrate the model have more than $10$ years and the sexual behavior of humans seems to have changed in the last ten years.

The simulations we are going to perform are:

\begin{itemize}
\item the study of the decline of warts with the current vaccination campaign in Spain: vaccination of girls with a coverage of $70\%$;
\item the study of the decline of oncogenic HPV with the current vaccination campaign in Spain;
\item the study of what would happen if the effect of the vaccine disappears suddenly after $20$ years;
\item the study to determine if the tourism in Spain has a significant effect on the HPV infection;
\item the study of the decline of oncogenic HPV if we vaccinate boys and girls with a high coverage;
\item the study of how long the decline is recovered after a drop in the coverage;
\item the study of how the decline of HPV is affected  if the average number of LSPs increases significantly;
\item the study of how the decline of HPV is affected  if the number of MSMs increases significantly.
\end{itemize}
