\chapter{Simulations}\label{HPVSpain}
In this Chapter, we are going to apply the model to several simulations, including different strategies in order to find out what we can expect applying these plans of action. Some of the simulations have been suggested in the previous chapter. These simulations will focuses in Spain, although they can be extrapolated to other countries. 

Some of these simulations are, in fact, a sensitivity analysis, with the aim to simulate characteristics occurring at the present time. We should not forget that the data used to build and calibrate the model have more than $10$ years and the sexual behavior of humans seems to be changed a lot in the last ten years.

Anyway, the goal of all of these simulations is to give tools to Public Health policy makers to make the right decision.
 
The simulations we are going to do are:

\begin{itemize}
\item the study of the decline of warts with the current vaccination campaign in Spain: vaccination of girls with a coverage of $70\%$;
\item the study of the decline of oncogenic HPV with the current vaccination campaign in Spain;
\item the study of what would happen if the effect of the vaccine disappear suddenly after $20$ years;
\item the study about if the tourism in Spain has a significant effect on the HPV infection;
\item the study of the decline of oncogenic HPV if we vaccinate boys and girls with a high coverage;
\item the study of the cost effectiveness of vaccinating only girls, only boys or both;
\item the study of how long the decline is recovered after a drop in the coverage;
\item the study of how change the decline of HPV if the average number of LSPs increases significantly;
\item the study of how change the decline of HPV if the number of MSMs increases significantly.
\end{itemize}
